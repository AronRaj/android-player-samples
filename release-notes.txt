    * Widevine Modular Playback Issue:

      Testing has uncovered a playback issue in the Widevine Modular
      integration for the Brightcove Android Player SDK that prevents
      playback in most cases. We are actively working on a solution to
      be released as soon as possible. Those using Brightcove
      ExoPlayer instead of the Widevine plugin should continue to use
      the Android Native Player SDK version 4.6.4.
