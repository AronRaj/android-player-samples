Brightcove Player Samples for Android, Release Notes:

Known Issues
Widevine Modular Playback Issue
Testing has uncovered a playback issue in the Widevine Modular integration for the Brightcove Android Player SDK
that prevents playback in most cases. We are actively working on a solution that will be included in our next Android
Player SDK release. Because of this, we are advising consumers of our Android Player SDK who integrate with Widevine 
Modular (those using Brightcove ExoPlayer instead of the Widevine plugin) to use the Android Player SDK version 4.6.4.

Version 1.0.1:

  BasicOnceUxSampleApp changes:

    * Upgraded to use versions 4.2+.

Version 1.0.0:

  BasicOnceUxSampleApp changes:

    * Added inital support for blackbox testing using the Android **uiautomator** feature.
